### Hi there 👋, Shubham Pandey
#### VLSI/GPU Design Engineer
I'm Shubham Pandey (your techy buddy for VLSI design)
  I do digital and hardware design using System Verilog+Verilog+VHDL hdl. I enjoy learning synthesizable constructs for module design, SoC design, Clock and reset architecture, and more to explore once you start reading.
  I have hands-on in synthesis, lint, formality, GLS vs Netlist, CDC(I have to read more) and RDC (yet to read).
  I am yet to get hands-on writing scalable testbenches for the designs I write. 
  I am also exploring hardware for Computational Neuroscience. This is an amazing research area. How amazing it would be if you can design hardware mimicking the basic neural activity of the brain.

Skills: System Verilog/VHDL/Verilog/C++/Python/bash_scripting

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various SYNTHESIS ALGORITHMS AND ADVANCED HARDWARE ARCHITECTURES to improve PPA.
- 💻 I'm currently learning system verilog for design and c++.
- 🌱 I’m using open-source tools such as IVERILOG, YOSYS, VERILATOR, etc to complete the front-end aspect of the design.
- 👯 I might look for collaborations on some projects in future. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with mapping and translation of design into FPGA i.e. backend stuff realated to FPGA synthesis.  
- 💬 Ask me about Digital Design, RTL design, FPGA, Hardware Accelerators, and Computational Neuroscience. 
- 📝 I have also designed synthesizable AMBA protocol based AHB APB bus bridge and slave peripheral (for college thesis couldn't do the verification part).
